## Issue Tree

The issue tree framework is a tool used to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components. Here are three key points to understand about the issue tree framework:

- **It is a visual tool**: The issue tree framework is typically presented as a visual diagram that consists of a main problem statement at the top of the tree, with branches that break down the problem into smaller, more specific components.

- **It helps to identify root causes**: By breaking down a problem into smaller components, the issue tree framework helps to identify the underlying root causes of the problem. This can help to develop more effective solutions that target the root cause of the problem rather than just treating the symptoms.

- **It is flexible and iterative**: The issue tree framework can be adjusted and refined as new information is gathered or as the problem is better understood. It is an iterative process that involves continuously refining the problem statement and breaking it down into smaller components until a solution is identified.
