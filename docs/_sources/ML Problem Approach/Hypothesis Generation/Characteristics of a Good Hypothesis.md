A good hypothesis exhibits the below characteristics:

* It should be **testable** the hypothesis that we frame must be capable enough to be validated or backed with evidences. If it cannot be tested, then the hypothesis becomes weak and is not a valid one to go after.

* Its should be **precise** means that the statement should be free from any ambiguity and it should not be misleading

* It should be **discrete** means that the hypothesis should focus on only a single unique claim rather than paving way for multiple outcomes to be verified

* It should be **mutually exclusive** meaning that the hypothesis framed should be independently verifiable and has less dependence on the outcome of other events taking place

Summarizing all of this: 

A hypothesis should be clear, specific, and testable, and it should be formulated in a way that can be tested through observation or experimentation. It can be used to guide research and experimentation and to help scientists make predictions about what they expect to find.
