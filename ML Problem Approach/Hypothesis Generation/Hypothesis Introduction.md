A hypothesis is an educated guess or tentative explanation for a phenomenon or observation that can be tested through further investigation and experimentation. It is a proposed explanation or prediction for a scientific question or problem, based on existing knowledge or previous observations.

To put in simplistic terms, hypothesis statements usually comprise of a condition that needs to be tested along with a visible/hidden outcome tied to it.

Once a hypothesis is formulated, it can be tested by gathering data and evidence through experiments or observations, and the results of these tests can either support or refute the hypothesis. 

If the hypothesis is supported by the evidence, it may become a theory or law that is widely accepted within the scientific community.
