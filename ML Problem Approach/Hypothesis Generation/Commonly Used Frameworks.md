## Commonly Used Frameworks

Below listed frameworks are commonly used to build and generate new hypothesis statements:

- **Fishbone diagram** : Also known as an Ishikawa diagram or cause-and-effect diagram, this framework is used to identify the root causes of a problem by breaking it down into smaller categories. The diagram is structured like a fish skeleton, with the problem statement at the head of the fish and branches representing different categories of causes.

- **Mind map** : This framework is used to organize ideas and information by creating a visual diagram that shows how different ideas are connected. The problem statement is placed in the center of the diagram, with branches representing different subtopics or ideas that are related to the problem.

- **Decision tree** : This framework is used to help make decisions by breaking down a problem or decision into smaller, more manageable components. The decision tree is structured like a flowchart, with each branch representing a decision or outcome that leads to the next step in the process.

- **Pyramid principle** : This framework is used to structure and organize written communication by breaking down ideas into smaller, more manageable components. The main idea or problem statement is presented at the top of the pyramid, with supporting points and details presented in descending order of importance.

Each of these frameworks is designed to help break down complex problems or information into smaller, more manageable components. They are all flexible and can be adapted to suit different types of problems or information.
